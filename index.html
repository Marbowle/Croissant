    <p>
      A croissant is a light flaky,and buttery viennoiserie pastry. It is named
      for its historical crescent shape. A croissant is made of a layered
      yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
      several times in succession, then rolled into a sheet, in a technique
      called laminating.
